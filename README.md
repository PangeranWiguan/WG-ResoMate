[![GitHub Release](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/PangeranWiguan/WG-ResoMate?label=Latest%20Release)](https://github.com/PangeranWiguan/WG-ResoMate/releases)
**WG-ResoMate** is a lightweight desktop application designed to simplify screen resolution management.

## **Key Features**
### **1. One-Click Resolution Switching**
- **Dynamic Button**: Automatically detects your current resolution and provides a single button to toggle between **1080p** and **4K**.
  - If you're at **1080p**, the button will say "Switch to 4K".
  - If you're at **4K**, the button will say "Switch to 1080p".
- **Instant Updates**: Your screen resolution changes instantly without navigating through system settings.
- **Keyboard Shortcut Support**: Press `Ctrl + R` to trigger the resolution change functionality.

### **2. Auto Close App Option**
- **Seamless Workflow**: A new toggle switch allows users to enable or disable the "Auto Close App" feature.
  - When enabled, **WG-ResoMate** will automatically close itself after changing the resolution. This is particularly useful for users who want a "set and forget" experience, as it eliminates the need to manually close the application after making changes.
  - When disabled, **WG-ResoMate** remains open after changing the resolution, allowing users to make additional adjustments or explore other features.
- **Persistent Preferences**: Your choice is saved and restored across sessions.

### **3. Dark Mode & Light Mode**
- **Personalized Themes**: Toggle between **Dark Mode** and **Light Mode** for a customized user experience.
- **Persistent Preferences**: Your theme preference is saved and restored when you reopen the application.

### **4. Native Windows Notifications**
- **Non-Intrusive Alerts**: Receive subtle **Windows notifications** when:
  - The resolution is changed.
  - You switch between **Dark Mode** and **Light Mode**.
- No more annoying message boxes‚Äîjust "click and forget."

## **Future Enhancements**
We‚Äôre committed to continuously improving **WG-ResoMate** to provide a more seamless and user-friendly experience. Here‚Äôs what we have planned for upcoming releases:
### **1. Improved User Interface**

### **2. Application Window Resizing**
- Add a new feature to resize open application windows to predefined sizes, such as **720p**, **1080p**, or other native resolution dimensions. This functionality will be particularly beneficial for users with high-resolution or ultrawide monitors, allowing them to simulate a multi-monitor setup within a single display. By resizing application windows to specific pixel-perfect dimensions, users can optimize their workspace for multitasking and improved productivity.
### **3. Localization**

## **From The Developer**
Hi there! üëã  
I made this software to simplify my daily routine when playing games or testing games. My monitor runs at **4K resolution** with a whopping **43-inch size**, but my computer is powered by an **8th-generation Intel i7** and an **RTX 2070**. While this machine is great for **1080p**, it struggles a bit with **4K resolution**.  
So, I created **WG-ResoMate** to quickly switch between resolutions depending on whether I‚Äôm gaming, working, or testing software. Honestly, this app started as a personal hobby project to meet my own "stupid needs," but along the way, I learned a ton about building desktop applications for **Windows 11**.  
If you find this tool useful, that‚Äôs awesome! And if you have any feedback or ideas to make it better, I‚Äôd love to hear from you. Thanks for checking out **WG-ResoMate**‚Äîhope it makes your life a little easier too! ‚ù§Ô∏è  
Happy resolution switching! üñ•Ô∏è‚ú®
