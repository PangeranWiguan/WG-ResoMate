**WG-ResoMate** is a lightweight desktop application designed to simplify screen resolution management. With a focus on simplicity and efficiency, this tool allows users to switch between **1080p (Full HD)** and **4K (UHD)** resolutions with ease.

## **Future Enhancements**

We‚Äôre committed to continuously improving **WG-ResoMate** to provide a more seamless and user-friendly experience. Here‚Äôs what we have planned for upcoming releases:

### **1. Dynamic Button Display**
- Automatically detect the current screen resolution and display only the relevant button (e.g., "Switch to 4K" if currently at 1080p, or "Switch to 1080p" if currently at 4K).

### **2. Current Resolution Display**
- Add a live display of the current screen resolution within the application for quick reference.

### **3. Native Window Scaling**
- Introduce a feature to adjust the application's window size to match **1080p**, **720p**, or other native resolutions, regardless of your system's scaling settings. This is particularly useful for users with high-resolution monitors who want to work in smaller, native-sized windows.

### **4. Improved User Interface**
- Redesign the UI to make it more modern, intuitive, and visually appealing, ensuring a professional look and feel.

### **5. Additional Quality-of-Life Features**
- Explore options such as:
  - **Resolution Profiles**: Save frequently used resolutions for quick access.
  - **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Allow users to switch resolutions using hotkeys for even faster workflows.
  - **Dark Mode**: Provide a sleek dark mode option for users who prefer a darker interface.
