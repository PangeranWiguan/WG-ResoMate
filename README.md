## **Future Enhancements**
We‚Äôre committed to continuously improving **WG-ResoMate** to provide a more seamless and user-friendly experience. Here‚Äôs what we have planned for upcoming releases:

### **1. Keyboard Shortcuts**

### **3. Application Window Resizing**
- Add a new feature to resize open application windows to predefined sizes, such as **720p**, **1080p**, or other native resolution dimensions. This functionality will be particularly beneficial for users with high-resolution or ultrawide monitors, allowing them to simulate a multi-monitor setup within a single display. By resizing application windows to specific pixel-perfect dimensions, users can optimize their workspace for multitasking and improved productivity.

### **4. Localization**

## **From The Developer**
Hi there! üëã  

I made this software to simplify my daily routine when playing games or testing games. My monitor runs at **4K resolution** with a whopping **43-inch size**, but my computer is powered by an **8th-generation Intel i7** and an **RTX 2070**. While this machine is great for **1080p**, it struggles a bit with **4K resolution**.  

So, I created **WG-ResoMate** to quickly switch between resolutions depending on whether I‚Äôm gaming, working, or testing software. Honestly, this app started as a personal hobby project to meet my own "stupid needs," but along the way, I learned a ton about building desktop applications for **Windows 11**.  

If you find this tool useful, that‚Äôs awesome! And if you have any feedback or ideas to make it better, I‚Äôd love to hear from you. Thanks for checking out **WG-ResoMate**‚Äîhope it makes your life a little easier too! ‚ù§Ô∏è  

Happy resolution switching! üñ•Ô∏è‚ú®
